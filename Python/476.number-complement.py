#
# Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement
# strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
# 
# Note:
# 
# The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
# integer.
# You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary
# representation.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: 5
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
# and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: 1
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and
# its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
