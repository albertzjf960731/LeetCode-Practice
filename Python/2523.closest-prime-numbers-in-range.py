#
# Given two positive integers left and right, find the two integers num1 and
# num2 such that:
# 
# 
# left <= num1 < num2 <= right .
# num1 and num2 are both prime numbers.
# num2 - num1 is the minimum amongst all other pairs satisfying the above
# conditions.
# 
# 
# Return the positive integer array ans = [num1, num2]. If there are multiple
# pairs satisfying these conditions, return the one with the minimum num1 value
# or [-1, -1] if such numbers do not exist.
# 
# A number greater than 1 is called prime if it is only divisible by 1 and
# itself.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: left = 10, right = 19
# Output: [11,13]
# Explanation: The prime numbers between 10 and 19 are 11, 13, 17, and 19.
# The closest gap between any pair is 2, which can be achieved by [11,13] or
# [17,19].
# Since 11 is smaller than 17, we return the first pair.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: left = 4, right = 6
# Output: [-1,-1]
# Explanation: There exists only one prime number in the given range, so the
# conditions cannot be satisfied.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= left <= right <= 10^6
