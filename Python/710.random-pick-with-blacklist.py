# You are given an integer n and an array of unique integers blacklist. Design
# an algorithm to pick a random integer in the range [0, n - 1] that is not in
# blacklist. Any integer that is in the mentioned range and not in blacklist
# should be equally likely to be returned.
# 
# Optimize your algorithm such that it minimizes the number of calls to the
# built-in random function of your language.
# 
# Implement the Solution class:
# 
# 
# Solution(int n, int[] blacklist) Initializes the object with the integer n
# and the blacklisted integers blacklist.
# int pick() Returns a random integer in the range [0, n - 1] and not in
# blacklist.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input
# ["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
# [[7, [2, 3, 5]], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
# Output
# [null, 0, 4, 1, 6, 1, 0, 4]
# 
# Explanation
# Solution solution = new Solution(7, [2, 3, 5]);
# solution.pick(); // return 0, any integer from [0,1,4,6] should be ok. Note
# that for every call of pick,
# ‚Å†                // 0, 1, 4, and 6 must be equally likely to be returned
# (i.e., with probability 1/4).
# solution.pick(); // return 4
# solution.pick(); // return 1
# solution.pick(); // return 6
# solution.pick(); // return 1
# solution.pick(); // return 0
# solution.pick(); // return 4
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= n <= 10^9
# 0 <= blacklist.length <= min(10^5, n - 1)
# 0 <= blacklist[i] < n
# All the values of blacklist are unique.
# At most 2 * 10^4 calls will be made to pick.
#
