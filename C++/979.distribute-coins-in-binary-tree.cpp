 * Testcase Example:  '[3,0,0]'
 *
 * You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the
 * tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole
 * tree.
 * 
 * In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one
 * node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to
 * parent.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly
 * one coin.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [3,0,0]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child,
 * and one coin to its right child.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [0,3,0]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root
 * [taking two moves]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the
 * right child.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is n.
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * 0 <= Node.val <= n
 * The sum of all Node.val is n.
