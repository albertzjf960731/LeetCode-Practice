 *
 * You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new
 * event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.
 * 
 * A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection
 * (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).
 * 
 * The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that
 * represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of
 * real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
 * 
 * Implement the MyCalendar class:
 * 
 * 
 * MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.
 * boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to
 * the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise,
 * return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input
 * ["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"]
 * [[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]
 * Output
 * [null, true, false, true]
 * 
 * Explanation
 * MyCalendar myCalendar = new MyCalendar();
 * myCalendar.book(10, 20); // return True
 * myCalendar.book(15, 25); // return False, It can not be booked because time
 * 15 is already booked by another event.
 * myCalendar.book(20, 30); // return True, The event can be booked, as the
 * first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= start < end <= 10^9
 * At most 1000 calls will be made to book.
 *
