 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4]'
 *
 * You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a
 * binary tree with the preorder traversing way.
 * 
 * The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And
 * you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the
 * one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary
 * tree.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
 * ⁠      1
 * ⁠    /   \
 * ⁠   2     3
 * ⁠  /    
 * ⁠ 4     
 * 
 * Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
 * Explanation: Originallay it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to
 * omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be
 * "1(2(4))(3)".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4]
 * ⁠      1
 * ⁠    /   \
 * ⁠   2     3
 * ⁠    \  
 * ⁠     4 
 * 
 * Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
 * Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we can't omit the
 * first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between
 * the input and the output.
