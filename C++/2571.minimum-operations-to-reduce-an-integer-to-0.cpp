 *
 * You are given a positive integer n, you can do the following operation any
 * number of times:
 * 
 * 
 * Add or subtract a power of 2 from n.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of operations to make n equal to 0.
 * 
 * A number x is power of 2 if x == 2^iÂ where i >= 0.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 39
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can do the following operations:
 * - Add 2^0 = 1 to n, so now n = 40.
 * - Subtract 2^3 = 8 from n, so now n = 32.
 * - Subtract 2^5 = 32 from n, so now n = 0.
 * It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations we need to make n
 * equal to 0.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 54
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can do the following operations:
 * - Add 2^1 = 2 to n, so now n = 56.
 * - Add 2^3 = 8 to n, so now n = 64.
 * - Subtract 2^6 = 64 from n, so now n = 0.
 * So the minimum number of operations is 3.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 10^5
