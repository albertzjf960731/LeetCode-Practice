 *
 * There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or
 * vacant.
 * 
 * Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the
 * following rules:
 * 
 * 
 * If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant,
 * then the cell becomes occupied.
 * Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
 * 
 * 
 * (Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the
 * row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)
 * 
 * We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i]
 * == 1 if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0.
 * 
 * Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after
 * N days (and N such changes described above.)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
 * Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
 * Explanation: 
 * The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
 * Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
 * Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
 * Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
 * Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
 * Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
 * Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
 * Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
 * Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000
 * Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * cells.length == 8
 * cells[i] is in {0, 1}
 * 1 <= N <= 10^9
 *
