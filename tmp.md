Dear Miss/ Mr. Committee Member:

I have known Mr. Junfeng for four years. He was a research assistant in my Intelligent Computing and System (Incas) Lab from Sep. 2018 till Jun. 2020, thereafter he worked on his graduation thesis under my supervision. With his dedication and strength in computer science, I can confidently assert that he will thrive in a challenging academic environment such as yours and excel in all the given tasks.

Junfeng was primarily working on a research project about fraud transaction detection with Graph Neural Networks. We held weekly meetings on research discussion during that time, and Junfeng was one of the very few individuals who understood cutting-edge knowledge quickly and thoroughly. He was able to provide his original thoughts and point out solutions, like a heterogeneous transaction network construction mechanism and Heterogeneous Adaptive Graph Neural Network (HetAGNN) algorithm. He also holds the responsibilities to conduct experiments to test the ideas, which was later formulated and published in ICDE 2021.

In the second year of his Masterâ€™s program, Junfeng became an indispensable member of the team. He took charge of a sub team to build a real application system from our research above. I observed him coordinating well amongst the group, dividing and allocating tasks to ensure timely progress of the team. He demonstrated strong leadership abilities and excellent coding and system designing skills. Junfeng also served as a teaching assistant for my data structures and algorithms class, and he played an important role in responding to students' questions after class. 

His graduation thesis was very impressive as well. Junfeng proposed an inductive collaborative filtering algorithm, IGCF, based on the local subgraphs, to address the situation that collaborative models cannot be generalized to new instances. His idea was both original and innovative. He developed it in depth and successfully applied for a patent for his research idea and system. 

Mr. Jufneng is modeling his academic and career path with equal aggressiveness and rationale. With a strong background in both AI research and application, he is further looking into the field of large-scale distributed system development to power AI landing and popularization. Mr. Junfeng is a very self-driven person. He tailors his own learning path and follows up with active source searching. He certainly needs another big stage. I would highly recommend Mr. Junfeng to be considered for a seat in the Master in Computer Science and Software Engineering Program in your university as he is sincerely a deserving candidate.

Sincerely,
